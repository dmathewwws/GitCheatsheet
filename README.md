##Going beyond push, pull and commit, tools for avoiding file and storyboard conflicts when working with iOS/XCode
for a formatted version to make it easier to read visit: https://workflowy.com/s/lY27LibSRg
###>> git stash
  To change branches without having to make a commit
####>> git stash list
####>> git stash apply
goes back to stash, watch for conflicts if you continue to work on the branch without applying the stash back on and then try to apply stash
#####>> git stash apply stash@{2}
will go back to stash index 2
#####Can reapply to another branch, read up for rules and conflicts
http://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing
####>> git stash save "your message here"
####>> git stash drop stashid
delete the stash (before or after applying)
###>> .gitignore
http://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Objective-C.gitignore
####may want to add dstore to your gitignore file
http://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657
####>> git rm --cached filename
this removes a file from git tracking, now you can put it in the .gitignore file
####>> touch .gitignore
do this inside directories you want to be tracked but are not currently being tracked because they are empty (empty folders are not tracked by default)
###Local and Remote Branches
####>> git branch -a
lists all local and remote branches
#####>> git branch -r
lists only remote branches
####>> git push origin origin:ref/heads/branchname
this creates a new remote branch
####>> git push origin :branchname
this deletes the branch from the origin remote
#####>> git checkout --track -b branchname origin/branchname
start tracking new branch so that you get the latest updates on pulls
####>> git branch -d branchname
this deletes the branch locally
###>> git reset --hard 
go back to a previous commit, deletes your current state, also achieved with >> git checkout -f
####>> git reset --hard 2393982
this will reset to the commit id starting with these numbers. You do not need the whole commit id, only the first few characters as they are unique.
####>> git reset --soft
as above but not a permanent move, will not delete the current state, return using the commit
###>> git log
shows the log of commits
####>> git log --pretty=oneline --graph --all
shows all commits and merges, good way to find unmerged commits or visualize your branch history
####>> git cherry
tells us which commits are not in the current branch
###Dealing With Potential Conflicts#
####>> git diff filename
this will show the changes to your file in Terminal
####>> git checkout filename
this allows you to commit without including the file, the changes in the file are reset, if you have a filename the same as a branch name use >> git checkout -- filename instead
####>> git update-index --assume-unchanged filename
temporarily ignore a file, it will remain ignored until you add it back to the index, this means it will not be merged.
#####>> git update-index --no-assume-unchanged filename
this adds the file back to the index, must do this is you want to merge your file
####>> git checkout --ours filename
this will tell git to keep our file if there is a conflict with a branch we are merging into
####>> git checkout --theirs filename
this will keep their file instead of ours
###>> git fsck --lost-found
if you reset --hard and realize that you actually needed the changes, the commit is not deleted immediately, it is "dangling". Use this to get the commit id and then >>git merge 2930923 will forward you back to the commit
